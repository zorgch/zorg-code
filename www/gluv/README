gLuV - gLu's Voyeur - A Q3 web based server monitor |
-----------------------------------------------------

displays the info using PHP, and displays as a web page.

Programmed by John Wu aka Strabo<-gLu-> (SegFault@sc.rr.com)

Features:
  - Displays all information a Q3 server query will return in an
      easily readable web page.
  - Shows the levelshot of the current map being played.
  - Works for normal Q3 servers, and OSP servers(more to come).
  - Parses fun names and OSP fun names and displays both foreground
      AND background colors!
  - Highlights the current row the mouse is over, for easy reading.
  - Shows team divisions, team scores, and # of player on each team
      in OSP.
  - Hovering over DM Flags will interpret them for you(Overlib by Erik Bosrup).
  - Pings are colored corresponding to the OSP ping colors.
  - URLs in rules are clickable.
  - Has a server listing which gLuV is called from.
  - Layout is customizable for the user via click and drag(Can be toggled).
  - Rule list can be closed to save room.
  - Layout can be preserved for each user via browser cookies.

Prerequisites:
  - A web server with PHP installed.

Installation:
  - Unzip/untar the files( for tar:  tar -xvzf gluv-x.x.x.tar.gz )
  - Move the files into your web directory and give appropriate
      permissions( I assume you know how to do this ).
  - Modify options.php to suit your needs.
  - If desired, glu.css can be modified to change the look of the page.
  - If using extra map paks, extract the levelshots to [GLUV]/images/maps/
      where [GLUV] is gLuV's home directory.
  - If using a URL in a rule, it must have "http://" at the beginning for
      gLuV to recognize it as a URL.
