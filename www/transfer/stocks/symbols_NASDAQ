Moissanite, also known by its chemical name, silicon carbide (SiC), is a rare,
naturally occurring mineral found primarily in meteorites. As the sole
manufacturer of scientifically-made moissanite jewels, we are creating a unique
brand image which positions moissanite as a jewel in its own right, distinct
from all other jewels based on its fire, brilliance, luster, durability and
rarity.

Our moissanite jewels are made from SiC crystals grown by Cree, Inc. Cree has an
exclusive license to a patent related to a process for growing large single
crystals of SiC. We know of no other producers of SiC that could currently
supply lab-grown SiC crystals in qualities, sizes or volumes suitable for use as
moissanite jewels.&nbsp;&nbsp;... More...""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2003%2f03%2f26%2f0001021408-03-005072.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" &nbsp;&nbsp;"

the fallopian tubes. A successfully placed Essure prohibits the egg from

form of silicon-on-insulator, or SOI, technology that creates an insulating
barrier below the top surface of a silicon wafer. Our proprietary oxygen
implanters produce SIMOX-SOI wafers by implanting oxygen atoms just below the
surface of a silicon wafer to create a very thin layer of silicon dioxide
between the thin operating region of the transistor at the surface and the

Novoste, a Florida corporation, has developed the Beta-Cath ™ System, a
hand-held device to deliver beta, or low penetration, radiation to the site of a
treated blockage in a coronary artery to decrease restenosis. Restenosis, the
renarrowing of a previously treated artery, is the major limitation of
percutaneous coronary angioplasty or PTCA, a procedure used by interventional
cardiologists to open blocked coronary arteries. Coronary stents, metal tubes or
coils permanently deployed at a blockage in a coronary artery, were developed to
reduce the incidence of restenosis, however restenosis still occurs in greater
than 15% of the patients who receive stents. In August 1998, we qualified to

molding of components from Bakelite, the first commercially available polymer

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

Automotive vehicle access systems, which are both theft deterrent and end user
friendly, are being developed as mechanical-electrical devices. Electronic
companies are developing user identification systems such as bio-systems, card
holder (transmitter) systems, etc., while locks and door latches are
metamorphosing to accommodate the electronics. This will result in more secure
vehicles and eventually passive entry and passive start.&nbsp;&nbsp;... More...""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2003%2f08%2f28%2f0000950134-03-012320.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" &nbsp;&nbsp;"
